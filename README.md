# Lab 17: Natural Language Processing
## Challenge: Find a data set and prepare it to create a model for Sentiment Classification

#### I chose the hotels review dataset because it has a lot of reviews in it which have various ratings that can be split to positive(2), negative(0) and neutral(1) sentiments. I also lost 4.28% of the data after cleaning it.

#### Sentiment distribution:
* 12868 Positive reviews
* 9747 Neutral reviews
* 11759 Negative reviews

This dataset is the closest to the even distributen that I could find so far.

I will use 80% of this dataset to training and 20% for testing.
